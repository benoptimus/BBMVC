BBMVC - A Model-View-Controller framework for BlackBerry Java applications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A simple Model-View-Controller framework
- About 2+ years old
- I built it originally because I wanted more well structured projects/code (and couldn't find anything that already existed)
- Includes a Navigator class that handles all navigation between screens

It's current project structure works for Eclipse but I'll be adding a JDE project file as well. I'll also be bringing over the example (will be in a separate repository).
